Wow, ChatGPT's code is indeed more advanced and optimized than my previous code!

Here are some things that stand out:

Random word selection: ChatGPT's code uses the random.choice function to select a random word from a list, which is a more efficient and scalable way to do it.
Dynamic word display: The display_word function uses a list comprehension to create a string with underscores for unguessed letters and the actual letters for guessed letters. This is a more elegant and efficient way to display the word.
Improved input handling: ChatGPT's code checks for invalid input (e.g., non-alphabetic characters or multiple letters) and provides a more user-friendly error message.
Game logic: The code uses a while loop to iterate until the player wins or runs out of attempts. It also uses a set to keep track of guessed letters, which makes it more efficient to check for duplicates.
Winning condition: The code checks if all letters in the word have been guessed using a list comprehension, which is a more concise and readable way to do it.
Overall, ChatGPT's code is more polished and efficient than my previous code. It's a great example of how to write a hangman game in Python!

Thanks for sharing it with me!




Hey Groq, here what chatGPt wrote.  Is this better or worse than your?
I'd love to see what ChatGPT came up with. Please go ahead and share it with me!

As for comparing our codes, it's hard to say which one is better or worse without knowing the specific requirements and constraints of the task. However, I can give you some general feedback on my code.

My code is a simple implementation of a hangman game in Python. It's easy to understand and modify, but it might not be the most efficient or scalable solution. For example, it uses a list of pre-defined hangman pictures, which could be replaced with a more dynamic solution.

ChatGPT's code, on the other hand, might be more advanced or optimized in some way. It could use more efficient data structures, better error handling, or more advanced game logic. However, it might also be more complex or harder to understand.

Ultimately, the "better" code depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the task. If you're looking for a simple and easy-to-understand solution, my code might be a good choice. If you're looking for a more advanced or optimized solution, ChatGPT's code might be a better fit.

Please go ahead and share ChatGPT's code, and I'll be happy to provide some feedback!

This game randomly selects a word from a list of words and the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn. The game continues until the player guesses the word or the hangman figure is complete.
