CONVRSTATION WITH META....

Can yo answer the following question form a worksheet in the comuter p[rpogramming lab:

Anna has recently learnt about multi-line programming in Python and has written a simple script that incorporates all the lessons she learnt:

print("Hello, World!")
print()
print("This is the first line. \nThis is the second line.")
print('''Three quotes can be used also
to print multiple lines using a single print function''')
Now, she wants to add these three comments inside her code in the appropriate places:

print() function will leave an empty line
\n is used to signal Python to start a new line
Three quotation marks can also print multiple lines
Please fill in the blanks below and assist Susan in writing well-commented scripts that she will find easier to understand later.

Tip: Think about where each comment would best explain the corresponding code functionality.

print("Hello, World!")

print()

print("This is the first line. \nThis is the second line.")

print('''Three quotes can be used also
to print multiple lines using a single print function''')
Here's Anna's updated script with the added comments:
Python
# Print a greeting message
print("Hello, World!")

# print() function will leave an empty line
print()

# \n is used to signal Python to start a new line
print("This is the first line. \nThis is the second line.")

# Three quotation marks can also print multiple lines
print('''Three quotes can be used also
to print multiple lines using a single print function''')
Why? Why did you put the comments where yo did?
I placed the comments where I did to provide clear explanations for the corresponding code functionality:
# Print a greeting message explains the purpose of the print("Hello, World!") statement. However, upon reevaluation, I realize this comment might not be necessary, as the code is self-explanatory.
# print() function will leave an empty line is placed above the print() statement to highlight its purpose. This comment helps clarify that the empty print() statement is intentional and serves to create a blank line in the output.
# \n is used to signal Python to start a new line precedes the print statement containing the newline escape sequence (\n). This comment explains the purpose of \n in the code.
# Three quotation marks can also print multiple lines is placed before the print statement using triple quotes. This comment explains the alternative method for printing multiple lines using three quotation marks.
By positioning the comments directly above the relevant code, they provide immediate context and help Anna (and others) understand the functionality and purpose of each section of the code.
